## KPI Dashboard

**KPI Dashboard** (formerly *Dynamic Chart Builder*) is a data analytics application that helps visualize industrial safety and performance metrics from raw detection data. It allows users to define flexible KPIs, apply filters, and view results in interactive charts and tables.

The system processes CSV files containing detections of humans, vehicles, pallet trucks, and AGVs. It computes and visualizes insights such as:

* Humanâ€“vehicle close calls within a defined distance
* Overspeeding events by class, area, or time range
* Vest violations by class or zone
* Dwell time and risky areas based on near-miss density

Users can:

* Select metrics (e.g., count, unique IDs, average speed)
* Apply filters (time, class, vest, speed, heading, zones)
* Group results (by time bucket, class, zone, or ID)
* Choose chart types (bar, line, area, heatmap, etc.)
* Save and share KPI presets
